# Releasing / packaging the source

To hand off or archive the source tree, package a clean snapshot from git history rather than
zipping the working directory directly:

```bash
git archive -o ua-cast.zip HEAD
```

This produces exactly what's committed at `HEAD` - nothing else.

## Why not just zip the working directory

The raw working directory routinely contains things that must never leave this machine:

- **`.git/`** - full history, including anything ever committed and later "removed" (still
  recoverable from old commits).
- **`build/`, `app/build/`** - generated output; large, and not portable across machines/SDKs.
- **`.claude/`** - agent working artifacts (worktrees, logs). Logcat captures under here can
  contain full stream URLs, including Xtream credentials passed as query params - see the
  `.gitignore` entry for this directory.
- **`local.properties`, `*.jks`, `*.keystore`** - local SDK paths and, if present, signing keys.

`git archive` sidesteps all of this automatically: it only ever includes tracked files at the
requested commit, so anything git-ignored (or never committed) simply isn't in the output.

## Which APK to ship

`./gradlew :app:assembleRelease` produces four APKs, not one (see the `splits` block in
`app/build.gradle.kts`):

| File | Size | For |
|---|---|---|
| `app-arm64-v8a-release.apk` | ~11.9MB | every current phone |
| `app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk` | ~11.5MB | older 32-bit ARM devices |
| `app-x86_64-release.apk` | ~12.9MB | emulators |
| `app-universal-release.apk` | ~23.1MB | when you cannot ask what CPU the target has |

Native code (FFmpeg, via `nextlib-media3ext`) is ~78% of this app, so a per-ABI APK is less than
half the size of the universal one. Hand out the universal APK for a plain download link; upload
the three per-ABI APKs together if a store accepts multiple APKs per release. 32-bit x86 is not
built at all (see `ndk.abiFilters`).

For Play Store specifically, prefer `./gradlew :app:bundleRelease` - Play performs the same split
server-side from a single `.aab` and none of the above needs thinking about.

Each per-ABI APK gets its own `versionCode` (base × 10 + an ABI digit, see `androidComponents` in
`app/build.gradle.kts`); the universal APK keeps the plain base code. A store rejects multiple APKs
sharing one `versionCode`.

## Versioning

`versionCode`/`versionName` are supplied at build time via `-Puacast.versionCode` /
`-Puacast.versionName` (see `android-ci.yml` for how CI derives them from the run number) rather
than hardcoded in `build.gradle.kts` - a local `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease` without these
properties falls back to the defaults in `app/build.gradle.kts`.

Marking a new version touches **three** files, and they have to move together:

1. `app/build.gradle.kts` - the `versionCode`/`versionName` defaults a local build falls back to.
2. `.github/workflows/android-ci.yml` - `UACAST_VERSION_NAME`, which carries the same
   `major.minor.patch` with the run number appended. Leaving this behind makes CI artifacts claim
   the previous version, which is worse than no version at all since it looks authoritative.
3. `CHANGELOG.md` - a new section at the top. A version number with no record of what is in it
   tells a user nothing.

`versionCode` only has to increase monotonically; CI derives its own from the run number, so the
default in `build.gradle.kts` matters only for locally built APKs.

## Regenerating the baseline profile

**Current status: successfully run once (2026-07-30), on a Pixel 10 Pro emulator (API 37,
x86_64)** - `app/src/main/baseline-prof.txt` now leads with 24,973 lines of real per-method entries
from that run (1,667 `com.uacastplayer` methods covering the language picker -> Terms -> onboarding
-> Home flow), followed by the previous hand-authored wildcard block as a safety net for what that
scripted flow doesn't reach (see below - mainly playback/media3).

```bash
./gradlew :app:generateReleaseBaselineProfile
```

This requires a **connected device or running emulator** (there's no Gradle-managed emulator
configured in this project - `useConnectedDevices = true` in `baselineprofile/build.gradle.kts`).
It builds a throwaway `nonMinifiedRelease` variant of `:app` (applicationId `com.uacastplayer`, no
`.debug` suffix) plus the `:baselineprofile` instrumentation APK, installs both, and runs
`connectedNonMinifiedReleaseAndroidTest`, which should overwrite `app/src/main/baseline-prof.txt`
with the result on success.

**Earlier attempt** (Xiaomi Mi A2, Android 11 / API 30, rooted with Magisk): hung 25+ minutes with
no crash/ANR/dialog after `ProfileInstaller: Installing profile for
com.uacastplayer.baselineprofile` - a known category of `BaselineProfileRule` flakiness on
non-stock-AOSP/modified-ROM devices. Killed via `./gradlew --stop`; never produced a profile.

**What worked**: a Pixel 10 Pro emulator (`emulator -avd Pixel_10_Pro`, AVD image
`google_apis_playstore_ps16k`/android-37.1) doesn't hang, but hits a *different*, environment-specific
snag - `./gradlew :app:generateReleaseBaselineProfile` still fails, every time, at
`:baselineprofile:connectedNonMinifiedReleaseAndroidTest` with `Failed to receive the UTP test
results`. The on-device test itself is not the problem: its own logcat shows `OK (1 test)` and
`Benchmark: Baseline profile for com.uacastplayer is stable` (stable after 5 iterations) every
time - only Gradle's Unified Test Platform result-collection channel back from the emulator fails
in this sandboxed environment, so the task still reports FAILURE and never copies the profile back.
Gradle's own post-task cleanup then uninstalls both APKs regardless, so there's nothing left on the
device to retrieve after the fact.

**Workaround** (bypasses UTP entirely, reuses the APKs Gradle already built under
`app/build/outputs/apk/nonMinifiedRelease/` and `baselineprofile/build/outputs/apk/nonMinifiedRelease/`
from the failed Gradle run above):

```bash
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/nonMinifiedRelease/app-nonMinifiedRelease.apk
adb install -r baselineprofile/build/outputs/apk/nonMinifiedRelease/baselineprofile-nonMinifiedRelease.apk
adb shell am instrument -w -e class com.uacastplayer.baselineprofile.BaselineProfileGenerator#generate \
    com.uacastplayer.baselineprofile/androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner
adb pull "/storage/emulated/0/Android/media/com.uacastplayer.baselineprofile/BaselineProfileGenerator_generate-baseline-prof.txt" .
```

Running the instrumentation directly like this skips Gradle's uninstall-on-completion behavior, so
the output file is still on the device afterward to pull. The pulled file only covers what the
generator's scripted UI flow actually reached (language picker/Terms/onboarding/Home) - it contains
almost no `androidx/media3` or `com.uacastplayer.player` entries, since the generator never opens a
channel. Append the previous wildcard block (`HSPLcom/uacastplayer/**->**(**)**` +
`HSPLandroidx/media3/exoplayer/**->**(**)**`/`common/**`) to the end rather than replacing it
outright, so playback still gets AOT coverage the scripted flow doesn't exercise. Verify the merged
file compiles before committing: `./gradlew :app:compileNonMinifiedReleaseArtProfile`.

Once a run succeeds, review the diff before committing - a profile that shrank a lot usually means
the generator's UI automation didn't get as far as it used to (see the next paragraph), not that
the app suddenly needs less warm code.

**Why the generator clicks by accessibility role/tree-order instead of text**: none of the three
gate screens have `testTag`s, and `:baselineprofile` is a black-box `com.android.test` module (no
Compose semantics access across the process/APK boundary), so button labels would render in
whatever language the connected device's system locale resolves to - text matching would make the
script device-dependent. Tree order happens to disambiguate every gate correctly instead (see the
generator's own doc comment) - if a gate screen's layout order ever changes, the generator's click
targets need to move with it.
